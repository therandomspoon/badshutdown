download the mac setup file here: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/python-3.11.0-macos11.pkg.
(the file size was larger than 25mb so you get the download link)
run the setup file
then download the python file
and run it
and hopefully tinkter (box with button) should come up
if not your device may not support tinkter
